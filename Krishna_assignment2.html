    The <em>living and the non-living together</em> constitute the <b>environment</b>. <strong>Environment makes life possible on earth, 
    providing the means for existence</strong>. However, living beings do not appreciate the environment well enough. 
    Environmental health is on a rapid decline. What started with using natural resources like <i>wood, fossil fuels, 
    and water balance</i> has gotten so out of hand that natural resources are at the brink of vanishing forever.

   Pollution caused by man is the most significant reason for the environmentâ€™s degradation. <code>Water, land, soil, and 
   noise pollution</code> are toxic to the environment. Throwing out garbage here and there, washing clothes and dishes in the pond and 
   river water using chemical soap causes water pollution. <small>As a result, the creatures living in the water end up dying.</small>

   The increase in vehicles on the road causes air pollution, and it causes a spike in gases like CO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> <sup>(greenhouse gases) </sup>
   that cause acid rain,which destroys buildings,<del>lands,humans</del> and monuments. Continuous honking on the roads by vehicles results in noise pollution. 
   Pollution affects the environment and harms us, and it affects our health and causes various cardiac and respiratory diseases. 
   If environmental pollution is not controlled, living on earth will become tougher, and finally, <ins>it will lead to the destruction of humankind.</ins>
