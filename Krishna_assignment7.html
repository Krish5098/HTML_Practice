    <h1>Dog</h1>
    <p>
        The <b>dog (Canis familiaris[4][5] or Canis lupus familiaris[5])</b> is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called the domestic dog, 
        it is derived from the extinct Pleistocene wolf,[6][7] and the modern wolf is the dog's 
        nearest living relative.[8] Dogs were the first species to be domesticated[9][8] by 
        hunter-gatherers over 15,000 years ago[7] before the development of agriculture.[1] Due to their long association with humans, 
        dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals[10] and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.

    <h2>Dog Breeds</h2>
    <p>
        People have been breeding dogs since prehistoric times. The earliest dog breeders used wolves to create domestic dogs. From the beginning, 
        humans purposefully bred dogs to perform various tasks. Hunting, guarding, and herding are thought to be among the earliest jobs eagerly 
        performed by the animal destined to be called <i>“man’s best friend.”</i>
