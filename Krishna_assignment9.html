    <h1>Dog</h1>
    <p>
        The <b>dog (Canis familiaris[4][5] or Canis lupus familiaris[5])</b> is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called the domestic dog, 
        it is derived from the extinct Pleistocene wolf,[6][7] and the modern wolf is the dog's 
        nearest living relative.[8] Dogs were the first species to be domesticated[9][8] by 
        hunter-gatherers over 15,000 years ago[7] before the development of agriculture.[1] Due to their long association with humans, 
        dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals[10] and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.
